# dot Net Academy ASP MVC

Create application to store and show information about added place on map:<br />
Must have:
    
*     after click on button should add place to “database”
*     should have google map on index page
*     map should showing saved places
*     placed should be the same for all users
*     place should have description, name and all required fields

Nice to have:
*  showing added places in “real time”
